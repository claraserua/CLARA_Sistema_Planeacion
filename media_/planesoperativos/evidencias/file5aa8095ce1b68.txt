Asunto:	Conference call to start planning North American Symposium in Ottawa

Dear Carlos, Jessica and Zak,

I hope this email finds you well! We are all excited about this fall’s symposium in Ottawa! When is a 
good time next week or the week of March 26 to hold a conference call to start the planning of this fall’s 
symposium? With Jonathan and David traveling all this week, I thought I’d leave them off the email 
thread for now and bring them back in once they are in the office. William and I can check with 
Jonathan’s assistant for his available times once we have a better idea on availability. Arizona is now -2 
with CDMX and -1 with Calgary.

Looking forward to working together and to the conversation,

Sapna
