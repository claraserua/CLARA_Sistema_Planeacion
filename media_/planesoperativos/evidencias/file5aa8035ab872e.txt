Dear Jessica De Alba-Ulloa,
This email confirms that you are on at least one submission to ISA’s 2018 
Annual Convention in San Francisco! Thank you for your interest, and 
involvement, in our convention.
We will review all proposals this summer and build the convention program. 
ISA will make the formal program publicly available on September 21st, 2017. 
If you have not already done so, we always recommend you log in and review 
your submissions on our website here: 
 
http://www.isanet.org/Conferences/San-Francisco-2018/Submissions.
Anything listed under "Submitted Proposals" will be reviewed by our section 
program chairs.
Although ISA does not require participation confirmations, looking at your 
submissions gives you an opportunity to make sure you are aware of, and 
comfortable with, every submission on which you appear. It happens 
sometimes that an individual constructs a proposal and puts on someone who 
was not previously contacted. In those rare instances, we may expect you to 
participate even though you were never actually asked to do so. Therefore, if 
you believe that you had not consented to be on the program and are receiving 
this email, please contact ISA as soon as possible at: isa@isanet.org.
Thank you for your support of ISA and your interest in our convention; we look 
forward to a great convention in San Francisco next April.
Sincerely, 
Faten Ghosn and Ismene Gizelis 
ISA 2018 Program Chairs
